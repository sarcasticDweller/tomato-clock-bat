# Why?  
I've been doing a lot of company training on productivity and a lot of it was quite boring. One of the videos I was forced to watch was a how-to on using the [pomodoro technique](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pomodoro_Technique), and I got to thinking: this deserves some code. Unfortunately, all I can really make and run on a work computer is a batch script or some JavaScript in an HTML file. HTML sounds like way too much boilerplate! So, batch it is.

# Should *You* Use this?  
Probably not! It is not the best tool in the world. I'm not your boss though, you do you.
